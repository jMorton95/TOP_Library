# TOP_Library
Library Project from The Odin Project Cirriculum

To Do:
    --Minor Features--
-Card Text Wrapping
-Add page button animation for more responsiveness
-More Professional Colour Scheme and Layout

Key Take-aways:
1: This Project was my first instance of using JavaScript Object Constructors, setting their prototypes and linking DOM Element properties with object properties.
2: I wrote an external JS file with pre-built dummy object data to be used to quickly generate DOM Elements to quickly showcase functionality.
3: Using a streamlined Grid layout for positioning and sizing HTML elements for a professional document flow.
